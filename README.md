# Weather-App
A very simple Weather App using Kotlin. This App would use the users device location to make an API call to get the areas weather.


This is a practice android app project. <br>
My goal with this project was to learn how to access the device location API and also make RestAPI calls.

## What I learnt
- How to request permissions from users.
- How to install, setup and use ktor for HTTP requests.
- How to serialize and deserialize data using kotlin.
- How to change ImageView sources.
- How coroutines consume RAM is not set up right.
- Improved my Kotlin skills.
